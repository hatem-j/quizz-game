# quizz-game

This is the source code of Quizz game, really simple one that was made for practice sake.

The global architecture, as you may already noticed, it's a server/client architecture.

So the first step is to tun the server, right after that, launch the client code, give "127.0.0.1" as an IP address.

A prompt will ask you for the port number, it should be: 50030.

Enjoy
